In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with `NSDateFormatter`.  Improperly setting the `dateFormat` string can lead to unexpected behavior, including crashes or incorrect date parsing.  For instance, using an ambiguous format or one that doesn't match the locale's conventions can result in inconsistent results across different devices or systems.  Another issue is failing to handle date parsing errors gracefully.  If `dateFromString:` returns `nil`, the application may crash if this isn't checked for.
